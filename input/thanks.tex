\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:thanks}

First of all, I would like to thank Michel {\sc Visser} and Simone {\sc Potenza}, co-founders of Konnektid, for hiring me as a trainee in their company.
I address special thanks to Simone {\sc Potenza}, for his precious advising and help as my supervisor.

I am also very grateful for the good work atmosphere, the mutual aid, and all the nice moments spent together with the Konnektid team.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Bruno {\sc Arnaldi}, my referent teacher during this traineeship, for his availability and helpful feedback.

Finally, I thank my engineering school: the \guillemotleft{} Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es \guillemotright{} (INSA) of Rennes,
and more specifically the Computer Science department, for the knowledge acquired during my formation but also for allowing me to conduct such an interesting internship.
