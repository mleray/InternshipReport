\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:thanks}

First of all, I would like to thank Michel {\sc Visser} and Simone {\sc Potenza}, co-founders of Konnektid, for hiring me as a trainee in their company and for giving me the opportunity to learn web development.

I address special thanks to Simone {\sc Potenza}, for his precious support as my supervisor, and for the variety of projects he allowed me to work on.

I am also very grateful for the good work atmosphere, the mutual aid, and all the nice moments spent together with the Konnektid team. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank Bruno {\sc Arnaldi}, my referent teacher during this traineeship, for his advising.

Finally, I thank my engineering school: the \guillemotleft{} Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es \guillemotright{} (INSA) of Rennes,
and more specifically the Computer Science department, for the knowledge acquired during my formation but also for allowing me to conduct such an interesting internship.
