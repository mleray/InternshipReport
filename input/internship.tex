\section{Internship progress}
\label{sec:internship}

The internship cannot fit into a specified project, as the goals and strategy
were changed every month, so this section will follow the same structure.
This may be a bit unconventional, but it seems to be the best way to render
the work that was accomplished.

\textbf{I listed here all the tasks I accomplished so far, for each month,
obviously a selection will be needed to focus on the main ones}

\subsection{July}
\label{ssec:july}

Big change this month: the team and the OKRs are divided in two squads: Supply and Demand.
The Supply squad decided to focus on improving the /teachers page, using the following process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Brainstorm (structure, important info, inspiration from other conversion pages\ldots)
\item Implementation of feature flag and creation of a mockup
\item Iteration on the mockup after feedback from the team
\end{itemize}

The next planned step is to test this new /teachers page by sending invites to potential teachers and increase the conversion rate.

\ldots To be continued
